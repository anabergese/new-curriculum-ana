      <p class="description">I'm a Software Engineer and former Anthropologist, graduated from Le Wagon.  
      This site was built using Ruby on Rails, one of the core technologies I learned during the bootcamp.  
      Recently, Iâ€™ve focused more on backend development and discovered a strong interest in software architecture. Planning and designing scalable, maintainable solutions is something I truly enjoy.</p>
